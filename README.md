BYTESPDYDER ENCRYPTOR
(this works on linux only, i can make a version for windows)
enter a path of ur choice. be warned, every file in that path and every file in every subdirectory in that path
will be shredded until you decrypt it. The password you set doesnt get saved anywhere, so dont forget it.
